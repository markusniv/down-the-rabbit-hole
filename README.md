# down-the-rabbit-hole

A top-down roguelike game made with Unity in C#, featuring Zelda I -esque rooms laid in a randomized floor layout. The purpose of the game is to see how far down you can go, with the monster difficulty increasing every floor. There are multiple weapon types with randomized stats, as well as some helpful items for the player to use.
